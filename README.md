Project Title
: Code Quiz Homework - Week 4

<!-- A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists. -->

Motivation

The objective is to create a random password generator that randomly selects letters (Capitals and or lowercase), numbers and or special characters and combine them with a user selected quantity betweeen 8-128 characters. The user inputs the data into selected prompts after selecting the "generate password" button. After which the script is run to loop through and tabulate the criterea. Then display the results in the text area for the user to copy.
